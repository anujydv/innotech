low receiver sensitivity (down to -136 dBm), 		                802.11 b/g/n wireless LAN.

                                            COMBINING THESE FEATURES: 
                                            We are going to make a device that will boost the speed of our Relief Camps.
Our Device will create a WLAN and people connected to our network can send their location to our relief camps and they can save that person.
